# METU-BA4318-Spring2019

Homework related files and sample Python programs for METU BA4318 Business Data Processing with Python - Spring 2019.

BA4318 is a course that teaches Python within the context of business data. It can be classified as a very soft introduction to data science concepts. However, because we assume the students to start with absolutely zero knowledge of programming we do not cover any advanced topic. The course has two sample projects each semester one with a single dimensional data set and another with multidimensional data set. Students themselves propose and develop their own team project towards the end of semester.
